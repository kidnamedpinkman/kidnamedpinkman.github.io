<h3>Czym jest Extreme Ironing?</h3>

<p>Extreme ironing (also called EI) is an extreme sport in which people take ironing boards to remote locations and iron items of clothing. According to the Extreme Ironing Bureau, <br> 
extreme ironing is "the latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt. <br> </p>
<br>
<p>Part of the attraction and interest the media has shown towards extreme ironing seems to <br> 
center on the issue of whether it is really a sport or not. It is widely considered to be tongue-in-cheek. <br> </p>
<br>
<p>Some locations where such performances have taken place include a mountainside of a difficult climb; a forest; in a canoe; while skiing or snowboarding; <br> 
on top of large bronze statues; in the middle of a street; underwater; in the middle of the M1 motorway; <br> 
in a keirin cycle race; while parachuting; and under the ice sheet of a frozen lake. The performances have been conducted solo or by groups. <br> </p>
