<h3>What is Extreme Ironing?</h3>

<p>Extreme ironing (also called EI) is an extreme sport in which people take ironing boards to remote locations and iron items of clothing. According to the Extreme Ironing Bureau, <br> 
extreme ironing is "the latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt. <br> </p>
<br>
<p>Part of the attraction and interest the media has shown towards extreme ironing seems to <br> 
center on the issue of whether it is really a sport or not. It is widely considered to be tongue-in-cheek. <br> </p>

<p>Some locations where such performances have taken place include a mountainside of a difficult climb; a forest; in a canoe; while skiing or snowboarding; <br> 
on top of large bronze statues; in the middle of a street; underwater; in the middle of the M1 motorway; <br> 
in a keirin cycle race; while parachuting; and under the ice sheet of a frozen lake. The performances have been conducted solo or by groups. <br> </p>

<h3>History</h3>
<br>

<p>Extreme ironing was invented in 1997 in Leicester, England, by resident Phil Shaw in his back garden. <br>
Shaw came home from what he recalls as a hard day in a Leicester knitwear factory. <br>
Shaw had a number of chores to do, including ironing. Preferring the idea of an evening out rock climbing, <br>
he decided to combine the two activities into a new extreme sport. In June 1999, Shaw, who uses the nickname "Steam", <br>
embarked on an international tour to promote the activity. The stops included the United States, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. <br>
An encounter with German tourists in New Zealand led to the formation of a group called "Extreme Ironing International", and the German Extreme Ironing Section or GEIS. <br>
This has yet to popularize in North America. <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>As extreme ironing has branched off, the conditions can gain in extreme activity. <br>
For example, a branch of ironing has been developed that includes both bungee jumping and well-pressed clothing. <br>
Bungee ironing is what some would call the ultimate in the thrill of extreme ironing. <br>
